# Flight Check-In

Simple POC Spring Boot Application for:

* Making flight check-in.
* Displaying Reservation Details.
* It's consuming the Micro-service provided by ([flightreservation](https://github.com/ahmadmazen/flightreservation)) for doing this task.


#### Featuring [Spring Rest Template, Micro-service].
